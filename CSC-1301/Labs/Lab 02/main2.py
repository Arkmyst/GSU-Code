The Skelton to work with is :
int long_side = 12
int short_side = 10
int perimeter
perimeter = 2 * long_side + * short_side
printl("longSide= ", long_side)
printl("shortSide= ", short_side)
print("perimeter = : " * perimeter)
'''
long_side = 12
short_side = 10

perimeter = 2 * (long_side + short_side)
print("longSide = ", long_side)
print("shortSide = ", short_side)
print("perimeter = ", perimeter)

'''
So a couple errors with this was syntax errors in the form of incorrect use of int, misspelling of print command
A logic error would be when I have the variable perimeter incorrectly multiplying due to the placement of the multiplication of 2
