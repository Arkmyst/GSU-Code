'''
  Purpose:
    To create a piece of code that analyzes the board and tells the players if anyone makes a row.

  Pre-conditions (input): 
    1) The input consists of three lines each with 3 characters.

  Post-conditions (output): 
    1) Depending on the player (X or O), print the winner and clarify what kind of row? - (Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). 

    2) If neither player has won, you should print out “THIS IS TIE”
