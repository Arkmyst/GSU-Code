"""
Assignment: Write a Python function named extractCycle(graph, start).

Input:      An adjacency list representing a directed graph and a start node.
Output:     If the ‘start’ node is part of a cycle, return the cycle as a list of nodes.
            Otherwise, return an empty list.

For example, when the method is called with the following graph with start=0, it should return [0, 1, 2, 4, 0]

# Adjacency list representing the graph

# Testing the function
adj = [[1, 3], [2], [4], [], [0, 3], [2]]

print(extract_cycle(adj, 1))  # Should print [1, 2, 4, 0, 1]
print(extract_cycle(adj, 3))  # Should print []
