Initialize the Arrays: Two arrays, trust_counter and trusted_counter, 
        track how many people trust each person and how many people each person trusts, respectively.

Count Trust Relationships: For each trust pair [a, b] in the input, 
increment trust_counter[b] (indicating b is trusted) and trusted_counter[a] (indicating a trusts someone).

Identify the Judge: Loop through each person from 1 to n. A person is the judge if:
    They are trusted by n - 1 people (trust_counter[i] == n - 1).
    They trust no one (trusted_counter[i] == 0).

Return the Result: Return the judgeâ€™s label if found; otherwise, return -1 if no judge meets the criteria.
